function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

% You need to set these values correctly
X_norm = X;
mu = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
sigma = zeros(1, size(X, 2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: First, for each feature dimension, compute the mean
%               of the feature and subtract it from the dataset,
%               storing the mean value in mu. Next, compute the 
%               standard deviation of each feature and divide
%               each feature by it's standard deviation, storing
%               the standard deviation in sigma. 
%
%               Note that X is a matrix where each column is a 
%               feature and each row is an example. You need 
%               to perform the normalization separately for 
%               each feature. 
%
% Hint: You might find the 'mean' and 'std' functions useful.
%       
m = length(X(:,1));
% 
% for i=1:size(X, 2)
% mu(i)=sum(X(:,i))/m;
% sigma(i)=std(X(:,i));
% x=(X(:,i)-mu(i))./sigma(i);%X(:,i)-mu(i))表示每列的每个元素减去均值，./表示点除
% X_norm(:,i)=x;
% end

mu=mean(X) %不加分号可在执行时显示出结果
sigma=std(X)
for i = 1:size(X,2),
    X_norm(:,i) = (X(:,i) - mu(i)) / sigma(i);
